# Secre-Mail-F
An encryption machine that should ONLY be used along with the Secre-Mail app. You can find Secre-Mail at secre-mail.bubbleapps.io


Secre-Mail F can decrypt and encrypt messages! What could be better?

Use it the way you would use a regular Python executable file, and then copy the encrypted message into the Secre-Mail "Message" box.
Voila! You're done!
